Coding Challenge..

Initially dove right into trying to get OAUTH going, but struggled with Flask as Flask under Python3 has issues with
Oauth that I didn't end up wanting to dive into to recover.

So I went with the random user generator for the sake of time.

I managed to get a small Flask page working that displays 100 users
from the 1000 that I pulled from the random user generator.

I then began the process of creating a small Bootstrap template in Flask
to display the users, but didn't really have much time after getting the 
users to parse in the template to proceed with the next challenge which 
was to display them a bit nicer in a table that I can then sort and export to CSV.

Were I to have had a working Flask setup with a sample template ahead of time, I could have completed this challenge
on time, and perhaps circled back to the OAUTH piece to get that finished as well.
